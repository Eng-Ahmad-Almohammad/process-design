# Process & Design
## Who is the Site For?
### Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
## Target Audience: individuals
* What is the age range of your target audience?
* Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
* Which country do your visitors live in?
### and many others points
## Target Audience: Companies
* What is the size of the company or relevant department?
* What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
* Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
*  How large is the budget they control?
## Why People Visit YOUR Website

## Getting your message across using design
### The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
## Visual hierarchy
### Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
## grouping and Similarity
### When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.
